# About me

I am currently exploring the Sagebrush/Pinyon-Juniper communities of the Central Basin and Range. I am intrested in how these comunnities (or is it a community) interelate and disentangling how much of their relationship is successional and how much is ecotonal. I am currently exploring the realtionship of tree:shrub cover, community identitiy and climate influence how fire impacts these communities.
